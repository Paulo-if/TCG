### Repository for the subject Topics in Computer Graphics (TCG), promoted by the teacher [Bruna Mota](https://github.com/brunamota)
--- 
#### SUM√ÅRIO:
- This subject involved the creation of a game, in a group setting, with freedom in how we designed it. My group was made up of 8 people, and everyone contributed to the development of the game. Specifically, my role was the development of game mechanics, including attack, defense, and others. In addition to that, I was also responsible for leading the group.
